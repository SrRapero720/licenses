# INTRODUCCTION
All my mods (and rarely some other projects) are All-Rights-Reserved (no license file) or Polyform Strict License,
by default, those licenses are very restrictive and doesn't let other people mess with my stuff and do nasty things
like give support to TLauncher (eww). But I still want good actors to do fancy and amazing stuff with my code. So
I present to you my own made license: Java Redistribution and Personal Authorization License, or in short: J-RAP License
(technically is JRPA but for practical purposes I named it J-RAP license)

# WHAT IS A J-RAP LICENSE
Its a very simple and practical license that I (and only I can) grant to other developers to have right to modify and
redistribute my code under certain conditions, its free and for everyone who wants to make cool stuff, at the cost
of contact me via [Discord](https://discord.gg/PGCHbFtKXt).

AGAIN, ONLY CAN I GRANT IT.

This license must not be included on the forked project repository, because is not a end-user license, its a dev-to-dev
license /I grant to You a license). Include the license doesn't means I granted it to you. To validate if someone has a 
license granted by me, check the list below.
