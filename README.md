# WHAT IS J-RAP LICENSE?
Its a license i grant for only (and just only) my software which was
under All-Rights-Reserved or Polyform Strict License to other developers
which want to do cool things with my stuff, is free and for everyone, at
the cost of contact me via [Discord](https://discord.gg/PGCHbFtKXt)

That license is only granted BY ME (J-RAP) and no one else.
When a license is granted, is listed here:
who was granted, for what project is and the status of the license (because is not a open source license and will never be included on project repository)
